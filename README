The BeagleBone DVI-D with Audio Cape provides both DVI-D and Audio interfaces for BeagleBone boards. This board features a standard HDMI connector, which can be connected to a DVI-D monitor using a HDMI-to-DVI-D cable, and two standard 3.5mm audio jacks for audio input and output. The video output of the BeagleBone DVI-D Cape is limited to 16-bit so more pins at the expansion headers of BeagleBone can be available for other capes. The output resolution is hardcoded to 1024x768.
